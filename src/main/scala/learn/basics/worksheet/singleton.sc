/*
  Object

    - An object is a class that has exactly one instance.

    - It is created lazily when it is referenced, like a lazy val.

    - As a top-level value, an object is a singleton.

    - As a member of an enclosing class or as a local value, it behaves exactly like a lazy val.

    - An object is a value.

    - The definition of an object looks like a class, but uses the keyword object

/*
  Companion Objects:

    - An object with the same name as a class is called a companion object.

    - Conversely, the class is the objectâ€™s companion class.

    - A companion class or object can access the private members of its companion.

    - Use a companion object for methods and values which are not specific to instances of the companion class.
